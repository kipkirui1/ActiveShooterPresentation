<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Definition</h4>
<br></br>
<small><h8>According to the Justice department, a mass shooting is defined as an attack by an assilant using a firearm that ends in 3 or more casualities</h8></small>
</section>

<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Definition</h4>
<br></br>
<small><h8>An active shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.This could be one person or a group of people</h8></small>
</section>
<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Definition</h4>
<br></br>
<small><h8>According to a FBI study on 63 active shooter cases between years 2000 and 2013 they determined that there are 4 or 5 behaviours common to the potential attacker(s).These factors are refered to as stressors. Stressors are commonly memorialized, shared or otherwise noted in some way e.g in writing or in conversations by the assilant(s)</h8></small>
</section>
<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Definition</h4>
<br></br>
<small><h8>The data reflected that the active shooters were typically experiencing multiple stressors, an average of 3.6 separate stressors in the year before they attacked. The only stressor that applied in more than half the sample was mental health (62%, n = 39)</h8></small>
</section>
<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Definition</h4>
<br></br>
<small><h8>In 2019 alone, there have been 255 mass shootings in the USA as of August 5th 2019 - Per Gun Violence Archive</h8></small>
</section>
</section>


<Section data-transition="convex">
<Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Frequency</h4>

<br></br>
<Section data-transition="convex">
<small><h8>Even though the odds that you will personally be involved in a mass shooting are low, experts now indicate that they have become frequent enough to create the need for awareness & preparedness </h8></small></Section>

</section>

 <Section data-transition="convex"><h4>Frequency</h4>
 
 <br></br>
<Section data-transition="convex">
<small><h8>Since 2013, an active shooter incident has occured every 2 to 3 weeks in the United states (Red Cross). It has become important to look at the data around active shooting incidents to understand how to prepare, prevent and respond</h8></small></Section>

<h8>Firearms Acquisition</h8>
<br></br>
<small><h8>As part of the review on Active shooter's preparation, the FBI explored investigative records and attempted to identify how each active shooter obtained the firearms used in the attacks.</h8></small>
<br></br>
<small><h8> Most commonly (40%,n=25) the active shooter purchased the firearm or firearms legally and specifically for the purpose of executing the attack</h8></small>

<h8>Who does an Active Shooter Target?</h8>
<br></br>
<small><h8>The study revealed that the active shooter goes to a location with targets in mind and also shoot others who were at the same location, either because they presented an obstacle in the attack or for reasons that could not be identified</h8></small>

		  </ul></small>  
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>1. Denial</h8>
<br></br>
<small><h10>Most critical aspect during time of attack is your 'target availability'. If you recognize that you are under attack act quickly to reduce your target availability and move to the second stage (deliberation) as quickly as possible.The more time we spend denying that we are victims of an attack the lower the chances of surviving it.</h10></small>
<br></br>
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">

<small><h10>Normalcy Bias - This is a common cognitive bias where we under estimate the possibility of a disaster even though there is evidence and proof that it is happening or that it can actually happen</h10></small>

<section data-transition="convex">

<small><h10>It cannot happen here Syndrome - People think that bad things can happen to other people but not to them</h10></small>
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>2. Deliberation stage:</h8>
<br></br>
<small><h10>This is the point where people decide what to do or what action to take. Without a pre existing plan or deliberation the seriousness of this life threatening situation on your bodily system will severely limit your abilit to perceive your environment or make plans to act under duress</h10></small>
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">

<small><h10>Some of the sensory side effects during such high stress situtations include tunnel vision, audio exclusion, time dilations (things may seem to move in slow motion), out of body experiences and reduced motor skills</h10></small>

<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>Action points. What can you do in the event of attack?</h8>
<h8>Option 1 : RUN</h8>
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><li>Get out of the room immediately.</li></small>
<small><li>Keep your hands free and visible.During rescue operation it helps identify you as a non threat.</li></small>
<small><li>Don’t look for your belongings. Leave everything including your phone if it is not within quick reach.</li></small>
<small><li>Call 911 only when in a safe place.</li></small>
<small><li>Identify alternative exists whenever you enter public places.</li></small>
<small><li>Help others escape when possible, but evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.</li></small>
</ul>
</section>


<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>Option 2 : HIDE</h8>
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><li>Use door barricades.The heavier or more the better. Improvise from what you have around you.</li></small>
<small><li>Use improvised door stops (wooden stoppers) under the doors or use pre installed ones if available.</li></small>
<small><li>Use computer cables or ropes to make tactical stops on doors to deny access and delay ease of entry.</li></small>
<small><li>Close blinds,turn off lights to impair visbility in the room as much as possible.</li></small>
<small><li>Silence all electronic devices and make sure they won’t vibrate.</li></small>
</ul>
</section>
<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>Option 2 : HIDE</h8>
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><li>Don’t hide in groups.Spread out along walls or hide separately to make it more difficult for the shooter.</li></small>
<small><li>Try to communicate with police silently. Use direct text message to tag your location, or put a sign in a window.</li></small>
<small><li>Stay in place until law enforcement gives you the all clear.</li></small>
</ul>
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>Option 3: FIGHT</h8>
<br></br>
*This should be the last resort*
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><li>If you chose to seize the opportunity COMMIT to your actions and act as aggressively as possible against the shooter.</li></small>
<small><li>Recruit others to ambush the shooter with makeshift weapons like chairs, fire extinguishers, scissors, books, etc.</li></small>
<small><li>Be prepared to cause severe or lethal injury to the shooter.</li></small>
<small><li>Throw items and improvise weapons to distract and disarm the shooter.</li></small>
<small><li>If it gets to it and you have to grab the gun, pull it against your body you are much stronger that way than it being further away from you.Use your body weight.</li></small>
</ul>
</section>
<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>Other Notes</h8>
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><li><h8>Playing dead- has not been proven as a strategy and is not a good idea. Assailants have been known to circle back and fire at wounded people or those on the ground.</h8></li></small>
<small><li><h8>Use willpower, Use conscious effort. Whether or not you get hit refuse to be helpless in this situation.</h8></li></small>
<small><li><h8>Try keeping yourself calm by using tactical/ controlled/ combat breathing. This will help reduce your heart rate, improve concentration and ability to perceive your environment.</h8></li></small>
<small><li><h8>Never just hope and hide. Act to reduce your target availability. Freezing or just hiding under your desk is almost always the wrong thing to do. It leads to feelings of helplessness and increased stress levels. Taking action helps reduce stress levels</h8></li></small>
<small><li><h8>Know your exits. We are creatures of habit and will always all look for the same exits we came in from.If in a restaurant remember that there will always be an exit in the kitchen area as a fire code requirement. This is a good alternate escape route</h8></li></small>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section data-transition="convex">
<h8>What should you do when the Police arrive?</h8>
<br></br>
<ul>
<small><h8><li>70 % of active shooter incidents end in less than 5 minutes.Average response time is 3 minutes (per FBI study).</li></h8></small>
<small><h8><li>When police arrive at a scene put your hands up and spread your fingers to show you are not carrying anything that could be mistaken for a gun. Show them that you are not part of the threat.</li></h8></small>
<small><h8><li>Do not run towards officers or try to hug/cling on them.Their primary role there is to stop the killing. Avoid asking them questions or request first aid from them until assilant is neutralized.</li></h8></small>
</ul>
